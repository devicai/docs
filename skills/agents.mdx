# Agents API

The Agents API allows you to manage autonomous AI agents that execute multi-step tasks. Agents can use tools, handle approvals, and maintain execution state through threads.

## Capabilities

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete agents
- **Thread Management**: Create and manage execution threads
- **Execution Control**: Pause, resume, and complete agent executions
- **Approval Workflows**: Handle human-in-the-loop approval requests
- **Evaluations**: Evaluate agent performance with scoring criteria
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor daily and monthly costs

## Key Concepts

### Agent

An agent is configured through an embedded `assistantSpecialization` object that determines its behavior and capabilities:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Agent display name |
| `assistantSpecialization.presets` | System prompt / instructions |
| `assistantSpecialization.availableToolsGroupsUids` | Tool groups the agent can use |
| `provider` / `llm` | LLM configuration |
| `maxExecutionToolCalls` | Maximum tool calls per execution |

### Thread

A thread represents a single execution of an agent. Threads can be in the following states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Created, not yet started |
| `PROCESSING` | Actively executing |
| `WAITING_APPROVAL` | Paused awaiting user approval |
| `PAUSED` | Manually paused |
| `COMPLETED` | Finished successfully |
| `FAILED` | Encountered an error |

## Example: Create an Agent

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.devic.ai/api/v1/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer devic-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer Support Agent",
    "description": "Handles customer support tickets",
    "assistantSpecialization": {
      "presets": "You are a customer support agent. Be helpful and professional.",
      "availableToolsGroupsUids": ["support-tools", "crm-tools"],
      "model": "gpt-4o"
    },
    "maxExecutionToolCalls": 30
  }'
```

## Example: Create a Thread

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.devic.ai/api/v1/agents/agent-123/threads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer devic-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Analyze the Q4 sales report and create a summary",
    "tags": ["sales", "quarterly-report"]
  }'
```

## Example: Handle Approval

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.devic.ai/api/v1/agents/threads/thread-456/approval" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer devic-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approved": true,
    "message": "Proceed with the data export"
  }'
```

## Tool Access

Agents access tools through `availableToolsGroupsUids`:

1. Each UID references a **Tools Group**
2. Tools Groups can contain built-in tools or reference a **Tool Server**
3. When an agent executes, it can call any tool from its assigned groups
4. Use `enabledTools` to restrict to a specific subset

**Example**: An agent with `availableToolsGroupsUids: ["crm-tools", "email-tools"]` can use all tools from both groups.
