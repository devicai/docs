title: "What It Is"
description: "Manage and explore your native databases inside Devic, fully integrated with agents, MCPs, and assistants to power intelligent AI-driven workflows."
---

## Overview

The **Databases** module in Devic provides a native environment for storing, querying, and managing structured information without relying on external services.\
It is designed specifically to integrate with **agents** and **MCPs**, allowing artificial intelligence to access data directly and contextually.

Each database behaves as an optimized repository for AI-driven workflows: it can be used by agents in real time, connected to custom tools, or serve as a knowledge source for assistants.

---

## Key Features

- **Unified management:** handle all your databases from a single panel.  
- **Unlimited scalability:** create as many databases as you need with no extra configuration.  
- **Full flexibility:** add, modify, or delete fields and records dynamically.  
- **Integrated semantic search:** all tables include **Vector Search**, enabling meaning-based queries instead of exact matches.  
- **Complete interoperability:** databases can be consumed by **agents** and **MCPs** without external connectors.

## Overview Panel

The **Databases** section displays a summary of all active databases and their current status.

At the top, four key indicators are shown:

- **Total Databases:** total number of databases created.  
- **Total Rows:** total amount of stored records.  
- **Custom Fields:** number of user-defined custom fields.  
- **Vector Search:** indicates how many databases have semantic search enabled.

Each row in the list includes:

| Column            | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database Name** | Name of the database.                                                  |
| **Description**   | Brief description or alias of the dataset.                             |
| **Total Rows**    | Number of stored records.                                              |
| **Custom Fields** | Number of custom columns.                                              |
| **Vector Search** | Status of semantic search (Enabled/Disabled).                          |
| **Actions**       | Direct access to the detailed view of the database via the **View** button. |

## Available Actions

From the upper-right corner of the panel, you can:

- **Create a new database** using the **+ Create New Table** button.  
- **Explore an existing database** by selecting **View** in the _Actions_ column.

These actions take you to their dedicated sections:\
[Create a new database](/devic/databases/create-new-database) and [View and edit a database](/devic/databases/view-and-edit-database).
