## Overview

Native databases in Devic allow you to structure and manage information flexibly, without depending on external systems.\
From the main **Databases** view, you can create a new database in just a few steps and define its initial structure — name, entities, and custom fields.

## Create a New Database

1. Click the **+ Create New Table** button in the upper-right corner of the panel.  
2. In the **Create New Table** dialog, fill in the following fields:
   - **Table Name** _(required)_: the visible name of the database, such as `Clients` or `Orders`.  
   - **Description** _(optional)_: a brief summary of the purpose of the database.  
   - **Entity Name (Singular)** _(required)_: the name of the individual entity (e.g., `client`).  
   - **Entity Name (Plural)** _(required)_: the plural name representing the collection of records (e.g., `clients`).  
3. Select **Create Table** to confirm.

## Configure the Created Database

Once created, the table configuration view will open, where you can customize all its elements.

### Basic Information

- **Table Name:** edit the main name of the database.  
- **Color:** assign a reference color to identify it visually in the panel.  
- **Entity Name (singular/plural):** modify the names defined during creation.  
- **Include table in smart search:** enable or disable inclusion of the table in global semantic searches.
