## Overview

Each database in Devic includes a dedicated view where you can **browse, filter, and modify records** in real time.\
This interface centralizes all stored information and allows you to maintain data consistency without leaving the platform.

---

## Main Navigation

When accessing a database, you will see a table containing all available records.\
At the top, several key tools are displayed:

- **Vector Search:** perform semantic searches based on meaning instead of exact matches.  
- **Table Settings:** opens the side configuration panel for the database (structure, fields, colors, etc.).

## Filters and Advanced Search

Use the **Filters** module to narrow down the displayed information:

1. Select a field from the dropdown menu (for example, _Reference_ or _Client ID_).  
2. Enter the value you want to search for.  
3. Add multiple filters at once using the **Add another filter** button.

This allows you to segment data without complex queries, making record exploration fast and intuitive.

## Semantic Search (Vector Search)

The **Vector Search** engine allows you to run natural language queries across custom fields.\
It is ideal for context-based or meaning-based searches.

1. Click **Vector Search**.  
2. Type your query, for example:

How many orders have been placed?

3. The platform will interpret the intent and return the most relevant results based on the record content.

## Table Configuration

The side configuration panel — called **Table Settings** — lets you modify the structure or behavior of the database:

- **Table Name & Color:** adjust the database's name and identifying color.  
- **Entity Name (singular/plural):** edit entity names.  
- **Include table in smart search:** enable or disable inclusion in global semantic search.  
- **Custom Fields:** add, edit, or group existing fields.

### Custom Fields

The **Custom Fields** section defines the internal structure of the database.\
You can group fields and add as many as needed depending on the type of information you will manage.

- **New Group:** create a group to organize fields by category (e.g., _General Data_, _Tax Information_, etc.).  
- **Add Field:** add a new field inside the selected group.

Each field includes:

- **Field name**  
- **Data type** (e.g., _text_, _number_, _date_, _boolean_, etc.)  
- **Quick actions** to edit ✏️ or delete 🗑️ the field.
