description: "Learn how to invoke Devic agents through the API to integrate them with your applications or custom workflows."
---

**Devic** agents can be executed not only from the visual interface, but also **programmatically** through the public API.\
This allows you to integrate agents into external systems, automate workflows, or connect them with other corporate applications.

Each agent has a **dedicated endpoint** that lets you create new executions (threads) by sending instructions directly via HTTP.

---

## Base Endpoint

Each agent has a unique URL for creating executions:

`POST https://api.devic.ai/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/threads`

The `{agent_id}` parameter is obtained from the agent’s view, in the **“Agent API Documentation”** dialog.

## Usage Example

You can invoke an agent using any language that supports HTTP requests (JavaScript, Python, cURL, etc.).\
Below is an example in **JavaScript** using `fetch`:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.devic.ai/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/threads', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Process the monthly sales report',
    state: 'queued'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
