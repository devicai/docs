description: "Enhance your agents in Devic by using RAG to retrieve external information and contextualize their responses."
---

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** is the system that enables agents in **Devic** to access external information—such as documents, manuals, policies, or catalogs—and use it during execution to generate more precise and contextualized responses.

Thanks to RAG, agents can work with up-to-date or domain-specific data without relying solely on the model’s pretrained knowledge.

---

## How It Works

The platform includes a fully integrated **RAG system** that allows users to directly upload documents to enrich the model's context.

The process is **entirely automatic**:

1. The platform analyzes the uploaded documents and **splits them into sections or “chunks”** for better indexing and retrieval.  
2. It generates **automatic descriptions** for each fragment, helping the agent better contextualize the information.  
3. During execution, the agent decides **when and how to query** these fragments, integrating them dynamically into its operational context.

This approach removes the need for additional training or external integrations, allowing agents to work with **updated and specific knowledge** without added technical complexity.

With RAG, organizations can give their agents an extended memory that strengthens reasoning capabilities and improves precision in complex tasks.

## Configuring RAG in an Agent

To add RAG to an agent:

1. Open the agent from the Devic sidebar.  
2. Scroll to the **RAG** section.  
3. Select **Add document** and upload the files that will form part of the knowledge base.

Supported formats include:

- `.pdf`  
- `.docx`  
- `.txt`  
- `.csv`

Each file is processed automatically and displayed in the agent interface with its name and status.

## Document Preview and Summary

After uploading a document, you can view its details from the right-hand side panel.\
Devic displays **metadata** and an **automatic summary** of the content.

| Field                 | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**              | Name of the uploaded file.                                             |
| **Size**              | File size.                                                             |
| **Created / Modified**| Creation and last modification dates.                                  |
| **Summary**           | Summary of the content, automatically injected into the agent context. |

![Document details in the side panel](/rag-detail.png)

The **Summary** field can be manually edited to refine the document description.\
This allows prioritizing the most relevant information and optimizing agent queries.

## Best Practices

- Upload only the documents necessary for the agent's context.  
- Avoid overly long files or irrelevant content.  
- Update summaries when document content changes.  
- Use descriptive names to improve identification.  
- Review the document set periodically to ensure it remains up to date.

## Use Cases

| Agent Type   | RAG Application                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Legal**    | Consults contracts or legal texts stored in PDFs.            |
| **Sales**    | Looks up data in catalogs, product sheets, or price lists.   |
| **Technical**| Retrieves content from manuals or internal guides.           |
| **Support**  | Accesses knowledge bases or customer documentation.          |
