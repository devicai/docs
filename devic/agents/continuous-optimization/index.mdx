title: "What It Consists Of"
description: "Monitor, evaluate, and improve your agents' performance through Devic’s traceability and metrics system."
---

Continuous optimization is an essential part of the agents’ lifecycle in Devic.\
The platform not only allows you to **configure and run agents**, but also to **analyze their behavior and operational performance in detail** through a complete traceability system.

---

## Agent Behavior Monitoring

Each agent includes a detailed execution history that allows you to **visualize its performance in real time**.\
This panel provides information about each completed task, its duration, the evaluations obtained, and the associated token consumption.

The most relevant indicators include:

| Metric         | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Date**       | Date and time of execution.                                   |
| **State**      | Final state of the process (Completed, Pending, Failed, etc.). |
| **Tasks**      | Number of completed tasks and their success rate.            |
| **Duration**   | Total time spent on the execution.                            |
| **Evaluation** | Evaluation score obtained according to defined criteria.       |
| **Tokens**     | Resources consumed by the model during execution.             |
