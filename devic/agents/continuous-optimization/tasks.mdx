# Task Tracking and Execution Progress

Each execution of an agent in Devic is composed of a set of **tasks** that represent the individual steps or actions performed during the process.\
This task system allows you to **monitor progress, review partial results, and detect potential issues** in complex workflows.

---

## General Task Overview

From the executions panel, the **Tasks** column shows the number of completed tasks versus the total assigned.\
The circular indicator visually reflects the level of execution progress.

| Indicator                   | Meaning                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 **Completed (✔)**        | All tasks finished successfully.              |
| 🔵 **Partial (percentage)** | Some tasks completed, others still pending.   |
| ⚫ **Incomplete (0/5)**      | Execution stopped before tasks began.         |

## Thread Tasks

Clicking on an execution opens the **Thread Tasks** panel, which displays the details of each task processed during the flow.\
Each block includes the name, status, and a detailed description of the obtained result.

Each task contains:

- **Name:** identifier of the step within the flow (e.g., “BIA report collection”).
- **Description or result:** text generated by the agent with processed or analyzed information.
- **Status:** indicates whether the task was successfully completed or remains pending for review.
- **Timestamp:** date and time of execution for full traceability.

---

## Result Interpretation

The task panel allows you to inspect in detail the steps followed by the agent, facilitating:

- Analysis of content generated by each subprocess.
- Detection of gaps, repetitions, or errors.
- Validation of the logical execution sequence.
- Technical auditing of the model's behavior.

---

## Evaluation and Consistency

When tasks are successfully completed, their results are automatically integrated into the overall evaluation of the execution.\
This enables correlation between **performance, accuracy, and number of tasks completed**, providing reliable performance metrics.

<Note>
  Devic’s task system allows you to segment agent logic into auditable steps, ensuring transparency, traceability, and granular control over each execution.
