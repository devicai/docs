# Human Validation in the Execution Cycle

Devic incorporates a **Human in the Loop (HITL)** system that allows users to be included in the agent’s execution flow when **manual validation, correction, or approval** is required before continuing an automated process.

This functionality ensures that critical tasks can be reviewed and approved by a human responsible, maintaining traceability and control over the agent’s decision-making.

## Execution States

When an agent requires human intervention, the execution automatically enters the **“Waiting for Approval”** state.  
From the executions panel, you can view and filter tasks awaiting approval, along with their progress and evaluation.

The available states include:

| State                  | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queued**             | The execution has been created and is queued to begin.                       |
| **Processing**         | The agent is currently processing the task.                                  |
| **Completed**          | Execution finished successfully.                                             |
| **Failed**             | The execution failed due to an error or unexpected condition.                |
| **Terminated**         | The execution was manually stopped or halted by system conditions.           |
| **Paused**             | Execution temporarily paused until user action is received.                  |
| **Waiting for Approval** | Requires human review or approval before continuing.                       |

## Approval Process

Clicking on an execution in the **“Waiting for Approval”** state opens the validation window.  
There, the agent presents the **approval request** along with extracted data or the actions it intends to execute.

The user can:

- **Approve** the action so the agent can automatically continue the workflow.  
- **Reject and finalize** the execution, stopping the process.  
- **Continue with feedback**, adding comments or corrections that the agent must incorporate before proceeding.

The approval panel displays all relevant information the agent has gathered up to that point:  
for example, customer data, analyzed documents, or cross-referenced information.  
This allows the user to review results **within their operational context**, without leaving the agent interface.

## Benefits of the Human in the Loop Approach

Integrated human validation allows balancing **automation and control**, offering:

- **Safety and accuracy** in sensitive or high-impact tasks.  
- **Complete traceability** of human decisions within the automated workflow.  
- **Iterative learning**, enabling the agent to incorporate human feedback in future executions.  
- **Regulatory compliance**, in processes where human intervention is mandatory.

<Note>
The HITL system turns each approval or rejection into part of the agent’s operational learning, contributing to continuous improvement of its performance and reliability.
