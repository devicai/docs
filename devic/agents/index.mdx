# Agents

**Agents in Devic** are intelligent entities capable of **making autonomous decisions** until they achieve a specific goal.\
They are composed of four fundamental elements:

- **An LLM model** — the main reasoner.
- **A prompt** — the context and behavior rules.
- **A set of tools** — the actions it can execute.
- **A knowledge base (RAG)** — information sources the agent queries on demand using **semantic search**.

## How We Understand Them in Devic

Unlike other environments where agents are represented as flows or box-and-arrow diagrams, in **Devic we do not conceive agents as predefined flows**.

An agent **does not follow a rigid path**:\
the agent itself **decides which steps to take**, which tools to use, when to query its knowledge via RAG, and when to stop, **until it achieves the expected result**.

This allows Devic agents to be **autonomous, adaptive, and solution-oriented**, reacting to the contexts or data they encounter during execution.

## Functional Structure

An agent combines:

| Element                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt**                               | Defines its purpose, tone, instructions, and limits.                                                                                                                         |
| **LLM**                                  | The base model that analyzes, reasons, and decides what to do.                                                                                                               |
| **Tools**                                | The agent’s executive capabilities: querying data, sending emails, creating tasks, reading documents, etc.                                                                   |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Connects the agent with knowledge bases and databases using Vector Search. The agent decides when to retrieve relevant fragments and how to use them to support its answer. |

This combination makes it possible for the agent to **reason and act autonomously**, without requiring pre-programmed sequential flows.

## Interaction with Agents

Interaction with agents **is not continuous**, as it is with **assistants**.\
An agent **runs in response to a trigger**, performs its actions until it completes the task, and then finishes its cycle.

### Possible Execution Triggers:

- **Scheduled periodic runs** (for example, every day or week).
- **Webhooks** or external events that activate it automatically.
- **Other tools** or **agents** that trigger its execution.
- **Manual actions** from the Devic interface or API.

---

## Conceptual Example

An agent can be configured to:

1. Run every Monday morning.  
2. Query the weekly sales database (Vector Search).  
3. Generate a chart and a summary PDF.  
4. Send the report to the team via email.

During this process, **the agent decides**:

- Which tools to use (query database, retrieve knowledge, generate chart, send email).  
- In which order to use them.  
- When the task should be considered complete.

## In Summary

| Feature            | Agents in Devic                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**      | On demand or scheduled.                      |
| **Interaction**    | Not continuous (unlike assistants).          |
| **Behavior**       | Autonomous, outcome-oriented.                |
| **Design**         | Based on decisions, not visual flows.        |
| **Components**     | Prompt + LLM + Tools + RAG.                  |

<Note>
  Agents are the key component for intelligently automating complex processes in Devic: **they reason, retrieve knowledge with RAG, and act on their own until they achieve the goal**.
