title: "Moderation"
description: "Block sensitive, harmful, or inappropriate content before it reaches the model using Devic’s Moderation guardrail."
---

The **Moderation** guardrail analyzes input text and blocks any content considered unsafe or outside the defined policies.\
Its purpose is to prevent the agent from processing instructions that include toxic, harmful, explicit, discriminatory language, or anything that could compromise the integrity of the system or its users.

This guardrail uses specialized classifiers that determine whether the user’s content belongs to a restricted category.\
If a violation is detected, the message is stopped and not sent to the model.
