The **Mask PII** guardrail detects and masks personally identifiable information (PII) in the input text before it reaches the model. Its purpose is to ensure that agents do not process data that could compromise privacy or expose regulated information.

This guardrail scans the incoming text and automatically replaces sensitive data with safe placeholders, preserving the user’s intent without revealing their information.

## What Mask PII Detects

Mask PII analyzes the user’s input and replaces any detected personally identifiable information with a generic placeholder.\
Examples:

- “My card is 4111 1111 1111 1111” → “My card is [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]”
- “I live at 123 Main St, NY” → “I live at [LOCATION]”
- “My email is john.doe@example.com” → “My email is [EMAIL_ADDRESS]”

This allows the agent to work with the message **without exposing real data**.

## When to Use Mask PII

Mask PII is recommended for agents that:

- Process instructions that may contain personal data.  
- Operate in regulated environments (GDPR, HIPAA, internal compliance).  
- Interact with end users and must avoid storing or forwarding sensitive information.  
- Execute automated tasks where data must remain anonymized.
