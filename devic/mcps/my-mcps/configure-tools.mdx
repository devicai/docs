## Overview

Once your MCP has been created or imported, you can adjust the behavior of each **tool** from the configuration panel.\
Each tool represents an endpoint of your API and defines how the model will interact with it.

## Configuration Editor

When selecting a tool, the **editor** opens, where you can define the following fields:

- **Function name:** internal function name.
- **Description:** brief explanation of the tool’s purpose (example: “Retrieves studies categorized by type within a date range”).
- **Parameters:** parameters required by the API (name, type, and description).
- **Endpoint:** service path (`/api/analytics/studies/counts-by-type`, for example).
- **Method:** HTTP method used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

  Devic automatically detects parameters defined in the JSON and displays them as <strong>Detected Properties</strong>,
  ready to bind with the body or endpoint path.

## Editing modes

You can define a tool in two ways:

- **Form:** visual interface with editable fields for each property.
- **JSON:** structured view of the full schema, compatible with OpenAPI.

The **Generate** button converts the parameters defined in Form mode into their JSON equivalent.

## Advanced options

At the bottom of the panel, you’ll find additional settings:

- **Query Parameters:** parameters sent via URL (`?param=value`).
- **Path Parameters:** variables included in the route (`/api/{id}/data`).
- **Body Property Key:** main property of the JSON body.
- **Custom Headers:** custom headers for authentication or context.
- **Widget Binding:** links the tool with embedded widgets or SDKs.

## Validation and testing

Once the tool is configured, the MCP will be ready for use.\
You can test its execution from agents or assistants, or verify it in the **Tool Calls** tab, where all invocations are recorded.
