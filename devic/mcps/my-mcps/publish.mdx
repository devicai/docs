description: "Make your MCP available to agents, assistants, or external services through a public or private URL."

## Overview

After configuring and validating your tools, the final step is to **publish** the MCP so it can be used by agents, assistants, or external environments.

To do this, click the **Publish** button located at the top right of the panel.

## MCP Visibility

When selecting _Publish_, a configuration window opens where you can choose who will have access to the MCP server.

Available options:

- **Private — Only accessible by you:**  
  The MCP will only be accessible from your environment or by your agents.  
  Ideal for internal integrations or testing environments.

- **Public — Accessible to everyone:**  
  Makes the MCP available to any environment that supports the MCP protocol, such as ChatGPT or other Devic instances.  
  This option generates a **public access URL** for the server.

## Generated URL

During publication, Devic automatically creates a URL under the domain:

`https://mcp.devic.ai/<mcp-name>`

That address becomes the endpoint from which agents or external systems can invoke the MCP tools.
