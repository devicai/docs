## Sessions Panel

Once your MCP is published, you can access the **Sessions** tab to monitor in real time how agents or external services are interacting with your tools.  
From this panel, you can see usage statistics, average session duration, and details about each active connection.

## Session Analytics

At the top of the panel, you’ll find the main indicators:

- **Total Sessions:** total number of sessions created.  
- **Active Sessions:** how many sessions are currently active.  
- **Avg Duration:** average duration of active sessions.

The **Sessions Over Time** chart displays the evolution of connections over time, helping you identify activity peaks.

## Session Details

Below the chart, the **Session Details** table lists all connections made to the MCP.

Each row includes:

- **Session ID:** unique identifier of the session.  
- **Status:** current session status (e.g., _Connected_).  
- **Created / Last Activity:** timestamps of creation and last interaction.  
- **Protocol:** protocol used for the connection.  
- **Actions:** button to inspect the session’s activity.

## Detailed Session Activity

Clicking **View Activity** opens the **Session Activity** panel, where you can inspect each interaction within the session, including:

- **REQUESTS** made by the client or agent.  
- **TOOL EXECUTIONS** triggered.  
- **Results** and any error messages returned.

This allows you to audit agent behavior and troubleshoot issues in real time.

- **Success Rate:** percentage of successful executions.  
- **Avg Latency:** average response time.  
- **Failed Calls:** executions that resulted in an error.
