title: "Integration with LLMs"
description: "Connect your MCPs with language models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor, and enable their use from agents and assistants in Devic."
---

## Introduction

Integrating with **language models (LLMs)** allows your tools and services (MCPs) to be consumed directly by conversational models such as **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Cursor**, or even by **Agents** and **Assistants** defined within the Devic platform.

This turns your MCPs into **live conversational extensions**, capable of executing real functions from your SaaS or infrastructure when a model invokes them through natural language.

---

## Example: integration with ChatGPT

When a custom MCP is published through its URL, **it can be made available to any language model** compatible with the MCP standard.\
This includes ChatGPT, which allows you to configure custom connectors and invoke tools directly through conversation.

### How to enable it

1. Go to the **Connectors** section in ChatGPT.  
2. Enable **Developer Mode**.  
3. Create a new custom connector by entering the **MCP URL** (e.g., `https://mcp.devic.ai/suntropy-solar-service`).  
4. Select the **actions (tools)** you want to expose.  
5. Save the changes — ChatGPT will now be able to communicate with your MCP.

> 💡 **Tip:** From this point on, ChatGPT can invoke your tools directly within the conversational flow, allowing users to interact with your SaaS via natural language.

---

## Example of real execution

Once the MCP is connected, users can ask natural-language questions such as:

> _“How many solar inverters do I have available?”_  
> _“Show me the summary of solar studies for September.”_

The model, through the MCP, executes the corresponding tools and renders the visual results defined with widgets.

This not only displays data but can do so with **your SaaS branding**, thanks to widgets defined in Devic.

## Integration from Agents and Assistants

Beyond integration with ChatGPT or Claude, **MCPs can also be consumed directly from Agents and Assistants configured in Devic**.  
This allows your internal automations, workflows, or enterprise assistants to benefit from the same integration capabilities as an external language model.

- **Agents** can invoke MCPs within their task flows or scheduled executions.  
  See the specific documentation:  
  👉 [Agents → Tools](../agents/tools)

- **Assistants** can use MCPs during conversations or project integrations, showing interactive results or embedding widgets.  
  See the specific documentation:  
  👉 [Assistants → Tools](../assistants/tools)
