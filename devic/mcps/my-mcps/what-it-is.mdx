title: "What My MCPs Are"
description: "Create and manage your own MCP servers from internal APIs or services so language models can execute them directly."
---

## Overview

The **My MCPs** section allows you to transform your **APIs** or **internal services** into servers compatible with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standard.  
Each MCP server groups a set of _tools_ that language models can invoke directly from your agents or assistants.

In other words, Devic converts your API into a standard interface ready to perform real actions on your systems through natural language or automated workflows.

## Main panel

This view displays all MCPs created within your organization.  
Each card represents an active connector and includes:

- **MCP Name**
- **Service Description**
- **Status indicator** (green = active)
- **Quick access buttons:** edit, delete, or publish.

In the top-left corner, you’ll find the **Add custom MCP** button, which starts the process of creating a new connector based on your API.

  Click <strong>Add custom MCP</strong> to begin configuring an MCP server based on your API specification (OpenAPI or JSON).
</Card>

## Types of MCPs in the view

- **My MCPs:** connectors created by you from your own services or endpoints.  
- **Imported:** external integrations loaded from a file or public URL, without altering their original structure.

Both types appear within the same view, organized in separate sections.
