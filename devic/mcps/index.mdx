title: "What They Are"
description: "Organize your integrations and tools under the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard to connect agents and assistants with external or internal services."

## Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** extends the capabilities of language models by enabling them to execute actions on external or internal systems.  
In Devic, MCPs act as **integration interfaces** that connect agents and assistants with APIs, services, or custom functions.

Depending on their origin or purpose, you can work with three main types:

- **My MCPs:** transform your API into an MCP server with tools ready to be used by the models.  
- **Third-party imported MCPs:** access a catalog of integrations such as Google Calendar, Hubspot, or Jira.  
- **Built-in Tools:** leverage native tools such as sending emails via IMAP, generating PDFs from HTML, or reading spreadsheets.

## Using MCPs

Once created or imported, MCPs become available to all agents and assistants in the environment.  
They can be invoked through natural language or integrated into automated workflows.
