## Overview

**Built-in Tools** are native tools integrated into Devic that allow agents, assistants, and MCPs to perform common tasks without the need to develop external integrations.

These tools cover functions such as:
- **Document, email, and database management.**
- **OCR.**
- **Interaction with external services (SharePoint, web, email, etc.).**
- **Memory and knowledge persistence.**
- **Web browsing.**

## Purpose

Built-in Tools aim to **simplify integrations** and provide **ready-to-use capabilities**, enabling you to build intelligent solutions quickly and without technical complexity.

They can be used by:
- **Agents:** to execute automated actions within a conversation.  
- **Assistants:** to provide interactive and personalized responses.  

---

## Key Features

- **Immediate availability:** integrated into Devic with no additional configuration.  
- **Full compatibility:** can be combined within agent or assistant flows.  
- **Scalability:** multitenant, robust infrastructure, and connection to external data and processes.  
- **Automatic updates:** Devic maintains and updates tools without user intervention.
