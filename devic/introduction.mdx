title: "Introduction"
description: "Devic is an abstraction platform that allows **SaaS** companies to transform into **AI-native** organizations, integrating artificial intelligence into their internal processes and products without needing to build their own infrastructure."
---

The platform provides a unified environment to create, deploy, and operate AI-powered systems, combining **agents**, **assistants**, **vector databases**, and **tools (MCPs)** in an interoperable architecture.

Devic was born from the experience of a team of entrepreneurs and engineers who, after years of building SaaS products, identified the lack of a standard for incorporating AI in a structured, secure, and scalable way within enterprise environments.
