## 1. Select your model provider

When you log in to Devic, the first step is to choose the **model provider** that will run your agents and assistants.

In the top bar, you’ll find the model selector, with support for the following providers:

- **OpenAI**
- **DeepSeek**
- **Anthropic**
- **XAi**
- **Kimi-K2**

  Click the settings icon next to the provider name to authenticate using your API key.
</Card>

### Provider authentication

Before creating or running agents, you must authenticate your account using the **API Key of the selected model**.  
This step is mandatory: the platform will not allow you to proceed until authentication is completed successfully.

In the configuration window, enter:

- **Project Name:** an identifier for your project or environment.  
- **Project API Key:** the API key issued by the model provider.

To obtain your API key, refer to the official guides:

- [How to generate an API Key in OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)  
- [How to generate an API Key in Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started)  
- [How to generate an API Key in DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)  
- [How to generate an API Key in XAi](https://x.ai/api)  
- [How to generate an API Key in Kimi-K2](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/docs)

Once authenticated, the model becomes available for use in agents, assistants, and MCPs.
