title: "Moderation"
description: "Block sensitive, harmful, or inappropriate content before it reaches the model using Devic’s Moderation guardrail for your assistants."
---

The **Moderation** guardrail analyzes incoming text and blocks any content considered unsafe or outside defined policies.  
Its purpose is to prevent the assistant from processing instructions that include toxic, harmful, explicit, or discriminatory language, or anything that could compromise system or user safety.

This guardrail uses specialized classifiers to determine whether the user’s input falls into any restricted category.  
If a violation is detected, the message is stopped and not sent to the model.
