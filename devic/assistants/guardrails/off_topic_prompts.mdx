description: "Prevent assistants from responding outside the defined scope using Devic’s Off Topic Prompts guardrail."
---

The **Off Topic Prompts** guardrail analyzes whether the user's input stays within the assistant’s allowed context or scope.  
When it detects that a message is *off-topic* with a confidence level above the configured threshold, the instruction is blocked before it reaches the model.

## What Off Topic Prompts Detects

It evaluates whether the user’s message aligns with the thematic scope defined by the assistant’s administrator.

Example use cases:

- Keeping a support assistant within the technical domain.  
- Preventing responses to topics unrelated to the business.  
- Blocking instructions that steer the assistant toward personal or inappropriate conversations.

---

## How It Works

The LLM compares the user message with the description of the allowed scope.  
The system assigns a **confidence score** (0.0 – 1.0).  
The guardrail activates when:

- The content is considered *out of context*, **and**
- The confidence level ≥ configured threshold.
