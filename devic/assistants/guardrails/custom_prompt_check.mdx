description: "Create custom rules to control which instructions an assistant can process using Devic’s Custom Prompt Check guardrail."
---

The **Custom Prompt Check** guardrail allows you to define custom moderation rules using natural language.  
Its purpose is to block instructions that do not meet your defined criteria, ensuring the assistant operates within the intended scope.

This guardrail uses an LLM to evaluate each input and determine whether it matches the conditions described in your control prompt.

## What Custom Prompt Check Detects

Custom Prompt Check compares the user's message with the rule prompt you define.  
If the message **does not meet the rules** or falls outside the allowed context, the guardrail blocks it before it reaches the model.

### Example Use Cases

- Support assistants: prevent questions outside the technical scope.  
- Sales assistants: block inquiries unrelated to products or sales.  
- Internal assistants: restrict instructions that attempt to trigger unauthorized workflows.  
- Specialized chatbots: ensure they only respond within their professional domain.

## Advanced Configuration

### Model

Allows selecting the LLM responsible for analyzing inputs.  
Devic recommends using **gpt-4.1-mini**, which offers good accuracy at low cost.

### Confidence Threshold

Defines the minimum confidence level (0.0 to 1.0) required to activate the guardrail.  
A typical value is **0.70**:

- ≥ 0.70 → the message violates the rule and is blocked.  
- < 0.70 → the message is allowed to pass to the assistant.
