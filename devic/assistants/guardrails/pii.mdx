The **Mask PII** guardrail detects and masks personally identifiable information (PII) in user input before it reaches the model. Its purpose is to ensure assistants do not process data that could compromise privacy or expose regulated information.

This guardrail scans incoming text and automatically replaces sensitive data with safe placeholders, preserving the user's intent without revealing their information.

## What Mask PII Detects

Mask PII analyzes user input and replaces any detected personally identifiable information with a generic placeholder.  
Examples:

- “Mi tarjeta es 4111 1111 1111 1111” → “My card is [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]”  
- “Vivo en 123 Main St, NY” → “I live at [LOCATION]”  
- “Mi email es john.doe@example.com” → “My email is [EMAIL_ADDRESS]”

This allows the assistant to work with the message without exposing real data.

## When to Use Mask PII

Mask PII is recommended for assistants that:

- Process instructions that may contain personal data.  
- Operate in regulated environments (GDPR, HIPAA, internal compliance).  
- Interact with end users and must avoid storing or transmitting sensitive information.  
- Execute automated workflows where data must remain anonymized.
