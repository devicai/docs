description: "Configure and manage the tools available for your assistants in Devic: Built-in Tools, My MCPs, and Code Snippets."
---

**Tools** define the capabilities an assistant can use during a conversation.\
They function as **operational extensions**, allowing the model to **retrieve information, execute actions, or interact with external systems** directly from the chat.

Each Tool expands the assistant’s possibilities, making it more useful and autonomous within the conversational context.

---

## Overview of the Tools Panel

In an assistant’s configuration, the **Tools** section shows all the tools available during interactions with the user.

![Tools panel in an assistant](/tools-assistant.png)

From this panel you can:

- **Add new Tools** using the **Add tools** button.  
- **Configure** parameters and authentication for each Tool.  
- **Remove** the ones you don’t need.

---

## Adding New Tools

Clicking **Add tools** opens the main selector of available tools.\
Here you can choose among three tabs:

- **Built-in Tools** → Native tools included in Devic.  
- **My MCPs** → External integrations created within your organization.  
- **Code Snippets** → Reusable code fragments acting as mini-tools.

## Built-in Tools

**Built-in Tools** are native Devic tools that require no additional configuration.\
They allow the assistant to perform common tasks such as:

- **Search Knowledge** — Search information in the RAG or document base.  
- **Send Email** — Send emails directly from the conversation.  
- **Read Emails** — Read and analyze incoming messages.  
- **Databases** — Query or update records in databases.  
- **OCR** — Extract text from documents or images.  
- **Spreadsheet Tools** — Read or edit data in spreadsheets.  
- **Manage Tasks** — Create and update tasks.  
- **Files and Directories** — Access and manage files.  
- **PDF from Markdown / HTML** — Generate PDF documents

These tools are automatically maintained and cover the most common use cases.\
See the full documentation at:\
[**Built-in Tools List**](../mcps/built-in-tools/tools-list)

## My MCPs

The **My MCPs** tab shows the **MCP servers (Model Context Protocol)** configured within your organization.\
Each MCP may include multiple tools connecting the assistant to external services, corporate APIs, or internal integrations.

![My MCPs view](/my-mcps-assistant.png)

From this view you can:

- Add tools developed by your team.  
- Include public or shared integrations.  
- Configure credentials, endpoints, or connection parameters.

**Example Use Cases:**

- A sales assistant may use a **Zoho CRM** MCP to access customer data.  
- A technical assistant may connect to an **internal incident API** to register tickets.  
- An administrative assistant may generate reports in **Google Drive or Sheets**.

[**My MCPs**](../mcps/my-mcps/what-it-is)

## Third-Party MCPs (Imported)

In addition to your own MCPs, you can **import external MCPs** from the **Imported MCPs** tab.\
This allows you to incorporate tools created by third parties without manual setup.

![Imported MCPs view](/my-mcps-third-party-mcps.png)

To add one:

1. Go to the **Imported MCPs** section.  
2. Click **Import MCP**.  
3. Enter the URL or configuration file of the external MCP.

Once imported, the assistant can use its tools just like any other MCP.\
This is especially useful for adding **public or community-built integrations** from Devic partners or certified providers.

---

## Code Snippets

**Code Snippets** let you create small reusable code tools without developing a full MCP.\
They can be used to execute simple logic, calculations, or data transformations directly from the assistant.

![Code Snippets view](/code-snippets-assistant.png)

Each snippet may include:

- Code in **Python** or other supported languages.  
- Custom parameters.  
- Outputs that integrate into the assistant’s conversation.

You can create your first snippet using **Create First Snippet** or add new ones via **New Snippet**.

---

## Real Example

In this example, the assistant **Alexandria** uses several Tools during its conversation with the user:

- **Search Knowledge** → Retrieves relevant information from uploaded manuals.  
- **Send Email** → Sends summaries or documentation to the client.  
- **Databases** → Updates the status of logged incidents.  
- **Cliq MCP** → Connects to Zoho’s API to coordinate with internal teams.

## Best Practices

- Enable only the Tools required for the assistant’s purpose.  
- Verify MCP authentication before using them in production environments.  
- Use descriptive names to easily identify each Tool.  
- Leverage **Snippets** to automate small tasks without overcomplicating the assistant.  
- Avoid redundancy: if a Tool already covers a function, don’t duplicate it.
