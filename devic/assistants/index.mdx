# Assistants

**Assistants in Devic** are conversational interfaces that **interact in real time with users** (people or systems) to solve questions, execute actions, and deliver results within the same conversation thread.

They rely on three main building blocks:

- **An LLM model** — the understanding and generation engine.  
- **A prompt (System Instruction)** — the assistant’s context, rules, and voice.  
- **A set of tools** — the actions it can invoke during the conversation.

## How We Understand Them in Devic

Unlike **agents**, whose cycle is autonomous and aimed at completing a task from start to finish, **assistants** are optimized for **continuous dialogue**: they listen to messages, **reason and respond instantly**, and can also execute tools when needed (query RAG, send an email, query a database, etc.).

The result is an **interactive, user-driven experience** with on-demand action capabilities.

## Functional Structure

An assistant combines:

| Element                        | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt (System Instruction)** | Defines its purpose, style, limits, and response policies.                                    |
| **LLM**                        | Interprets the message, reasons, and drafts the response.                                     |
| **Tools**                      | Access data or execute actions (RAG, emails, databases, spreadsheets, MCPs, etc.).           |
| **RAG (optional)**            | Document source used to ground and contextualize responses with your domain information.      |

This combination allows the assistant to **answer accurately** and, when needed, **take action** through tools without leaving the chat.

## Interaction with Assistants

Interaction with assistants is **synchronous and continuous**: each user message can trigger reasoning and tool calls, returning an immediate response.

### Common Usage Channels

- **Web widget** embedded in your app or portal.  
- **API** to integrate it into other conversational flows or products.

---

## Conceptual Example

A support assistant can:

1. Read the user’s question about a procedure.  
2. Query **RAG** to find the relevant section of the manual.  
3. Reply with the steps and, if appropriate, **send a PDF** or open a related **task**.  
4. Maintain context for follow-up questions within the same thread.

During the process, **the assistant decides** whether it needs a tool (e.g., “Search knowledge”, “Databases”, or “Send email”) and how to combine it with its response.

## In Summary

| Feature           | Assistants in Devic                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction**   | Real-time, continuous conversation.                      |
| **Goal**          | Solve questions and execute actions within the thread.   |
| **Behavior**      | User-driven; can invoke tools on demand.                 |
| **Design**        | Conversational, with per-thread persistent context.      |
| **Components**    | Prompt + LLM + Tools (+ optional RAG).                   |

<Note>
  Assistants are ideal for **user support, internal help desks, and conversational front-ends**.\
  By combining conversation with tools and RAG, they deliver precise answers and can **act** without leaving the chat.
