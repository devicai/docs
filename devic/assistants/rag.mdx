title: "RAG"
description: "Enhance your assistants in Devic by using RAG to retrieve documentation and contextualize their responses."
---

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** enables **Devic assistants** to access documentation and use it in real time during conversations.\
Thanks to this capability, assistants can provide **more accurate, grounded, and up-to-date** responses, without relying solely on the model’s pretrained knowledge.

---

## How It Works

Devic’s RAG system is fully integrated with assistants and does not require complex configuration.\
When documents are added to an assistant’s knowledge base:

1. **The platform automatically analyzes** the content.  
2. **It splits the text into fragments** (“chunks”) to improve contextual retrieval.  
3. **It generates summaries** that are injected into the model’s context.  
4. During the conversation, the assistant **decides when to consult these documents** and uses the most relevant fragments to build its response.

This approach provides the assistant with **extended memory**, allowing it to contextualize answers using user-uploaded materials—such as manuals, reports, or internal guides.

---

## Configuring RAG in an Assistant

To add knowledge to an assistant:

1. Open the assistant from Devic’s sidebar.  
2. Navigate to the **Knowledge** section.  
3. Click **Add document** and select the files you want to upload

Supported formats:

- `.pdf`  
- `.docx`  
- `.txt`  
- `.csv`

Each document is processed automatically and displayed in the interface with its name and file type.

<Note>
  For the assistant to retrieve the uploaded documents, you must enable the **Search Knowledge** tool in its configuration.

## Document Details and Metadata

You can access each document’s details by clicking on it.\
The side panel will display its key information and metadata:

| Field                 | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**              | File name.                                   |
| **Size**              | Document size.                               |
| **Created / Modified**| Creation and modification dates.             |
| **Summary**           | Automatic or custom summary of the content.  |

![Document detail view and summary](/document-detail-assistant.png)

The **Summary** field is used internally to inject contextual information into the assistant’s prompt.\
You can edit it to highlight the most relevant data for your use case.

---

## Document Preview

From the same detail panel, you can **preview the full content** of the document directly in Devic—no download required.

This feature is useful for reviewing information before starting a conversation or refining document summaries.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the **Search Knowledge** tool is enabled if the assistant needs to use RAG.  
- Upload only documents that are relevant to the assistant’s scope.  
- Review automatically generated summaries and edit them if needed.  
- Use descriptive file names.  
- Keep documents updated to ensure coherent responses.  
- Avoid uploading excessively large or unstructured files.

## Use Cases

| Assistant Type          | How RAG Helps                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Technical Support**   | Retrieves manuals, installation guides, or product documentation.  |
| **Customer Support**    | Accesses FAQs or service sheets for accurate responses.            |
| **Sales**               | Looks up catalogs or updated pricing.                              |
| **Internal Training**   | Answers questions based on manuals or training materials.          |

---

## Practical Example

In this example, the assistant **Alexandria** has several technical documents loaded and can answer questions related to user manuals:

1. The user uploads `4011690_Manual Operador_e.pdf`.  
2. Devic automatically generates a summary with key points.  
3. During the conversation, Alexandria uses RAG to retrieve relevant fragments from the manual and provide precise instructions.
