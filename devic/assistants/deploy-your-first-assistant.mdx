**Assistants** are the most direct way to interact with models inside **Devic**.\
Unlike agents —which operate autonomously until completing a process— assistants are designed to **respond in real time** to user queries, combining reasoning, tools, and knowledge.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to create your first assistant and configure the components that make it functional: the **model (LLM)**, **prompt**, **tools**, and **RAG (knowledge)**.

---

## What Is an Assistant in Devic?

An assistant is a conversational entity that **responds directly to the user** inside the platform or through connected channels.\
It can reason, consult knowledge sources, execute actions via tools, and maintain conversation context within a thread.

Each assistant combines:

- A **language model (LLM)** that interprets and generates responses.  
- A **prompt** that defines its role, tone, and limits.  
- A set of **tools** that allow it to perform specific actions.  
- A **RAG space** where it stores documentation or reference information.

---

## Step 1: Create a New Assistant

From the Devic sidebar, open the **Assistants** section and select **+ Custom**.\
Assign a **name** and **description** that clearly represent its purpose.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | Main identifier of the assistant. Use a representative name like _Technical Support_ or _Sales Assistant_.       |
| **Description**  | Briefly explains the purpose or context of the assistant. Visible to project members.                            |

**Example:**

> “Assistant specialized in technical support for Globalsuite users. Answers inquiries and provides relevant documentation.”

---

## Step 2: Define the Prompt

The **prompt** (System Instruction) is the core of the assistant’s behavior.\
It defines who the assistant is, what it can do, and how it should communicate with the user.

A good prompt should include:

- Its **role** and main objective.  
- The **tone** and communication style.  
- **Behavioral rules** and boundaries.  
- Instructions on **what to do and what to avoid**.

**Prompt example:**

> You are Alexandria, a technical support professional specialized in Globalsuite.\
> Your role is to clarify steps and resolve questions about the platform’s processes or usage.\
> You may consult documents in the knowledge base and provide contextualized responses.\
> Do not generate answers that cannot be confirmed using the provided knowledge base or attached documents.

## Step 3: Choose the Model (LLM)

The **model** is the engine that powers the assistant’s reasoning.\
Devic allows you to choose between multiple providers and models depending on your needs for accuracy, speed, or cost.

### Available Providers

- **OpenAI** — GPT-4 and GPT-4o models.  
- **Anthropic** — Claude 3 models, ideal for advanced reasoning.  
- **DeepSeek** — An efficient, lower-cost alternative.  
- **XAi** — Grok models for general-purpose usage.  
- **On-Premise Models** — For private or compliance-heavy environments.

**Tip:**  
Choose the model that best balances **cost, latency, and answer quality** for your use case.

## Step 4: Add Tools

**Tools** extend the assistant’s capabilities, allowing it to perform actions during the conversation.\
Common tools include:

| Tool                              | Description                                        |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search Knowledge**              | Consults documents stored in the RAG.             |
| **Send Email**                    | Sends emails within the conversation context.     |
| **Databases**                     | Accesses or modifies stored records.              |
| **Spreadsheet Tools**             | Reads or writes spreadsheet data.                 |
| **MCPs (Model Context Protocol)** | Connects to custom external tools or services.    |

![Example of tools configured in an assistant](/add-tools-assistant.png)

**Recommendation:**  
Enable only the tools required for the assistant’s role.  
For example, a support assistant might use `Search Knowledge`, `Send Email`, and `Databases`.

## Step 5: Add Knowledge (RAG)

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** gives the assistant contextual memory, allowing it to access documentation while conversing.

To add knowledge:

1. Go to the assistant’s **Knowledge** section.  
2. Click **Add document** and select the files to upload.  
3. Supported formats include `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, and `.csv`.

**Example applications:**

- A technical assistant consults manuals or installation guides.  
- A support assistant reviews internal policies or client documentation.  
- A sales assistant checks product sheets or pricing tables.

## Step 6: Save and Test

Once you’ve defined the **prompt**, **model**, **tools**, and **knowledge**, click **Save changes**.\
The assistant will then be available for testing in the **conversation console** or for integration into other channels (web, email, API, etc.).

In the console, you can hold real-time conversations, validate its behavior, and refine its prompt based on the responses obtained.

| Element                         | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name and description**        | Identify the assistant and its purpose.              |
| **Prompt (System Instruction)** | Defines role, tone, and behavior.                    |
| **Model (LLM)**                 | Processes, reasons, and generates responses.         |
| **Tools**                       | Allow the assistant to take actions during dialogue. |
| **RAG**                         | Provides contextual knowledge from external docs.    |
